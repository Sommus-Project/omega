# OMEGA

Omega is a Node.js application framework for building Web based applications and REST APIs.

> Since it is a Node.js framework you will need to install Node.js to use it.

We will try to keep Omega compatible with both the [current release](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) and the [Active LTS release of Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/Release).

> As of July 1, 2019 we recommend using Node version 12.x. *Use a version no lower then 12.1.0.*


## Install

### Initialize your app folder

Create your application folder and initialize it as an npm compatible repo:

```
npm init
```

> Accept all of the default settings or adjust them as you desire.

### Install Omega

When your folder is set up you first need to install OmegaTools:

```bash
npm install --save-dev git+https://github.com/Sommus-Project/omega-tools.git
```

Then you install Omega:

```bash
npm install --save git+https://github.com/Sommus-Project/omega.git
```

### Create your app

Now create a simple app by creating the file `app.js` in your project's root folder with the following content:

```
const omega = require('@sp/omega');
const app = omega();
app.start();
```

Save the file.

### Create the static folder

Omega needs a location from which it can server static files. By default this folder needs to be called `static` and needs to be a sibling to your `app.js` file.

```bash
mkdir static
```

> You do not need to place any files in the `static` folder at this time.

### Start your app

Now that your simple app is written you need to start your app.

```bash
node app
```

### View your app

Open a Web Browser to `http://localhost:3000/system/node/npm`. The browser should auto redirect to `https://localhost:3001/system/node/npm` and will likely bring up a warning about invalid certificates or an insecure site. Just accept the certificates or allow the page to load and view the real page.

You should see a page that shows what NPM repos your application is using. It will look something like this:

| &nbsp; | Repo | Version |
| - | - | - |
| 1 | @babel/code-frame | 7.0.0-rc.1 |
| 2 | @babel/generator | 7.0.0-beta.51 |
| 3 | @babel/helper-function-name | 7.0.0-beta.51 |
| 4 | @babel/helper-get-function-arity | 7.0.0-beta.51 |
| 5 | @babel/helper-split-export-declaration | 7.0.0-beta.51 |
| 6 | @babel/highlight | 7.0.0-rc.1 |
| 7 | @babel/parser | 7.0.0-beta.51 |
| 8 | @babel/template | 7.0.0-beta.51 |
| 9 | @babel/traverse | 7.0.0-beta.51 |
| 10 | @babel/types | 7.0.0-beta.51 |
| 11 | accepts | 1.3.5 |
| 12 | acorn | 5.7.1 |
| 13 | acorn-dynamic-import | 3.0.0 |
| 14 | acorn-jsx | 4.1.1 |

## Using Omega

### Config Option Properties

When you call `omega()` you can pass in an object of configuration options. These options define how you want your app to run and gives you the ability to override some of the default functionality.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `apiDocs` | Boolean | `true` | Enable the API docs located, by default, at the `/api` url. |

If you don't want the default options values then call `omega()` with the values you want to change:

```js
omega({
  favicon: '/img/favicon.ico',
  fileLimit: '3mb',
  logFormat: 'combined',
  useProxy: false
});
```

#### `devMode`

Omega doesn't do anything different when in developer mode. It is up to each Omega application to do whatever they need to when in or out of developer mode.

#### `initAppFn`

The function `initAppFn` allows you to initialize things that are specific to the application. The most common thing done here is to make values available to the EJS pages.

> You have access to the `app` and `config` objects

**Example:**

```js
function initAppFn(app, options) {
  // Do your app specific initialization here
  // Provide values for EJS pages:
  app.locals.hosts = {
    self: `https://localhost:${options.httpsPort}`,
    proxy: `https://${app.locals.proxyHost}:${app.locals.proxyPort}`
  };
}
```

#### `initReqFn`

The function `initReqFn` allows you to initialize things that are specific to each request. This is where you should set up `onSend` and `onResponse` callbacks, see [Rest](docs/lib/Rest.md).

> You have access to the `req` ,`res` and application `options` objects

**Example:**

```js
function initReqFn(req, res, options) {
  // Do your request specific initialization here
}
```

#### `redirect`

The `redirect` object allows for domain name redirection.

Example:

```json
redirect: {
  server: {
     "dog.com": "cat.com",
     "testing.net": "testing.com"
  }
}
```

If the browser attempts to hit the node server using the domain name "dog.com" it will be redirected to the same path on "cat.com" or if it uses the domain name "testing.net" it will redirect to "testing.com"

The redirection will also only go to `https` so, for example, attempting to go to:

`http://dog.com/bark/and/eat`

will redirect to:

`https://cat.com/bark/and/eat`

#### `reqFinishedFn`

The function `reqFinishedFn` gives you application a place to do cleanup at the end of each request.

> The response has already been sent and the connection closed so you can not affect the response in any way.
>
> You have access to the `req` ,`res` and application `options` objects

**Example:**

```js
function reqFinishedFn(req, res, options) {
  // Do your request specific cleanup here
}
```

#### `proxyPostCallback`

The function `proxyPostCallback` gives your application a chance to examine and modify the response object from a proxy request before it is sent back to the browser.

> This only includes the header portion of the response and does not include the body.

The parameters sent to the `proxyPostCallback` are:

| parameter | description |
| - | - |
| `response` | The status and headers of the response from the proxy call. |
| `req` | The original request object that was sent to the proxy call. |
| `options` | The options that were created to determine what the proxy call was to be. |

**Example:**

```js
function proxyPostCallback(response, req, options) {
  // Do what you need to after the proxy request returns.
}
```

#### <a name="apiSystem">API System</a>

The `api` system uses two configuration properties, `apiFolder` and `apiUri`.

The `apiFolder` property is the relative folder from your application's root folder where the API System looks for API files.

The `apiUri` property defines where, in he app's URL, is the starting point for calling the API files.

##### Example

Assuming that we pass in the following configuration object to the API system:

```json
{
  apiFolder: 'src/api',
  apiUri: '/myapi'
}
```

And assuming that our API folder structure is like this:

```
src
 └─ api
     ├─ movies.js
     ├─ movies
     │   └─ (movieid).js
     ├─ users.js
     └─ users
         ├─ (uid).js
         └─ (uid)
             ├─ properties.js
             └─ properties
                 └─ (propid).js
```

Then the users can access the following endpoints:

```
http://localhost:3000/myapi/movies
http://localhost:3000/myapi/movies/:movieid
http://localhost:3000/myapi/users
http://localhost:3000/myapi/users/:uid
http://localhost:3000/myapi/users/:uid/properties
http://localhost:3000/myapi/users/:uid/properties/:propid
```
